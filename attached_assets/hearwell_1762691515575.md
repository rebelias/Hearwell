## When to Seek Urgent Care (Same day if possible)
- **Sudden hearing loss in one ear** (over hours to ≤3 days), with or without tinnitus/vertigo.
- **Neurologic signs** (face droop/weakness, numbness, severe headache, double vision).
- **Pulsatile tinnitus** (sound in sync with heartbeat), especially new/worsening.
- **Ear pain, fever, drainage**, or post-head injury hearing change.
> If in doubt, treat as urgent and arrange medical assessment.

## Symptom → What It Might Mean (At-a-Glance)

| Symptom | Common Causes | First Steps |
|---|---|---|
| **Ringing / hissing / buzzing (non-pulsatile)** | Noise-induced hearing loss, age-related loss, earwax, otitis, ototoxic meds, TMJ, stress/anxiety | Check earwax; review meds; basic hearing screen; protect from loud sound |
| **Pulsing sound (heartbeat-like)** | Vascular causes (venous sinus stenosis, AVF, carotid issues), high BP, anemia, thyroid dz, middle-ear myoclonus | Measure BP; medical eval; consider imaging per clinician |
| **Sound sensitivity / pain to sound** | Hyperacusis, migraine spectrum, anxiety, noise overexposure | Reduce overprotection, gradual sound enrichment, CBT-based support |
| **Ear fullness / popping** | Eustachian tube dysfunction, allergies, barotrauma, Ménière’s (if with vertigo/fluctuation) | Auto-insufflation (gently), treat nose/allergy, medical exam if persistent |
| **Vertigo + tinnitus + fluctuating hearing** | Ménière’s disease, vestibular migraine, SSCD | ENT/otology evaluation |
| **Rapid one-sided hearing change** | Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) | **Urgent ENT/audiology** |

## Condition Library (Plain-English Summaries + Links)

### Tinnitus (non-pulsatile)
A sound no one else hears—often ringing, hissing, whistling. Frequently linked to hearing-pathway changes after noise exposure, aging, or middle-ear issues. Anxiety, poor sleep, and stress can amplify it.  
Learn more: NIDCD overview → https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/tinnitus  
Clinician guideline (what good care looks like) → AAO-HNS CPG: https://www.entnet.org/quality-practice/quality-products/clinical-practice-guidelines/tinnitus/

### Pulsatile Tinnitus
A rhythmic sound in time with your heartbeat. Needs medical evaluation to rule out vascular/middle-ear causes. Work-up may include targeted imaging based on exam.  
Recent imaging approach: JNIS review/algorithm → https://jnis.bmj.com/content/17/9/916

### Hyperacusis (Sound Sensitivity / Loudness Discomfort)
Everyday sounds feel too loud or painful. Often co-occurs with tinnitus, migraine spectrum, or anxiety. Care focuses on **graded sound exposure**, counseling, and avoiding constant earplug use in safe environments.  
NIH/NCBI review → https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557713/

### Ménière’s Disease
Spells of vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and ear fullness (classically unilateral). Salt moderation, trigger management, and specialist care are typical.

### Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss (SSNHL)
Rapid inner-ear hearing drop (usually one ear) over ≤72 hours. **This is an emergency.** Early audiometry and evidence-based treatment (often steroids) improve odds of recovery.  
Guideline hub → https://www.entnet.org/quality-practice/quality-products/clinical-practice-guidelines/sudden-hearing-loss-update/

### Noise-Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL)
From loud concerts, tools, gunfire, or long-term headphone overuse. Prevention (limits + protection) is key; hearing aids help when loss occurs.

### Presbycusis (Age-Related)
Gradual high-frequency hearing decline; speech sounds less clear, especially in noise. Modern hearing aids and communication strategies help.

### Eustachian Tube Dysfunction (ETD)
Ear pressure/fullness, popping, muffled hearing, often after colds/allergies or flights. Treat nose/allergy; autoinflation; specialist if persistent.

### Otitis Media/Externa
Middle/outer ear infections causing pain, fullness, muffled hearing, sometimes drainage. Needs clinical diagnosis and targeted treatment.

### Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) Disorders
Jaw tension/clenching can drive ear symptoms (ache, fullness, non-pulsatile tinnitus). Dental/jaw care, PT, stress reduction can help.

### Ototoxic Medications (Drug-related Ear Effects)
> Some antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides), chemotherapy (e.g., cisplatin), loop diuretics, high-dose salicylates/NSAIDs, and others can cause tinnitus or hearing loss. **Never stop a prescribed drug without medical advice.**

### Vestibular Schwannoma (Acoustic Neuroma)
Usually slow-growing benign tumor on the hearing/balance nerve. Clues: one-sided tinnitus or hearing loss, imbalance. MRI diagnoses; ENT/neuro-otology manages.

### Vestibular Migraine
Migraine biology causing dizziness/vertigo ± sound sensitivity/tinnitus. Lifestyle, trigger control, and preventive meds may help.

### Superior Semicircular Canal Dehiscence (SSCD)
A tiny bony opening in the balance canal; sound/pressure-induced dizziness, autophony, hyperacusis. Diagnosed with high-res CT + clinical tests.

### Otosclerosis
Abnormal stapes bone fixation → conductive or mixed hearing loss ± tinnitus. Hearing aids or stapes surgery are options.

### Cholesteatoma
Skin-lined growth behind the eardrum; causes chronic drainage, hearing loss. Requires ENT surgical care.

### Perilymph Fistula & Barotrauma
Inner-ear fluid leak after pressure/trauma; dizziness, hearing change, tinnitus. Specialist evaluation needed.

### Autoimmune Inner Ear Disease (AIED)
Immune-mediated inflammation → rapidly progressive/fluctuating loss ± tinnitus; steroid-responsive in some.

## Tests & Self-Checks

### 1) Quick Hearing Screen (at home)
- **Your web audiometer:** https://83462523-5252-40b6-9813-cbbf90a734e8-00-2e6ot11pr9bsa.riker.replit.dev/audiometer  
  > Use over good headphones, in a quiet room. This is **not** a diagnosis—abnormal results → book formal audiometry.

### 2) Formal Clinical Tests (ordered by a clinician)
- **Pure-tone audiogram & speech testing** (baseline for almost everything).  
- **Tympanometry** (middle-ear pressure & eardrum mobility).  
- **Otoacoustic emissions (OAEs)** (outer hair-cell function).  
- **ABR** if neural pathway issues suspected.  
- **Targeted imaging** for **pulsatile tinnitus** or red flags (MRI/MRA/MRV/CT as indicated).

## What Actually Helps? (Evidence-Based)

### For Non-pulsatile Tinnitus
- **Education + reassurance:** Tinnitus is a common brain/ear signal—severity often improves when you understand it.  
- **Address hearing loss:** **Hearing aids** can reduce tinnitus intrusiveness by restoring input and enabling sound enrichment.  
- **Sound therapy/enrichment:** Low-level ambient sound (nature tracks, broadband noise, tailored soundscapes) especially at night.  
- **CBT-based approaches:** Reduce distress, improve sleep and quality of life.  
- **Sleep & stress care:** Treat insomnia/anxiety; exercise and mindfulness help.  
- **What to skip (unless specific indication):** Routine benzodiazepines, routine supplements (e.g., ginkgo) lack consistent benefit; avoid extreme sound deprivation.

### For Hyperacusis
- **Graded exposure + sound enrichment** (do not live in earplugs).  
- **Treat comorbid migraine/anxiety.**  
- **CBT/skills training** for sound tolerance.

### For Pulsatile Tinnitus
- **Check blood pressure, anemia, thyroid, pregnancy, new meds.**  
- **Specialist exam + appropriate imaging** (rule out vascular/middle-ear causes).  
- **Treat the cause** (e.g., BP control, venous stenosis stenting in selected cases, glomus tumor care, etc.).

### For SSNHL (Emergency)
- **Immediate audiology/ENT**, early treatment per guideline (often oral or intratympanic steroids), consider MRI to rule out retrocochlear causes.

## Practical Daily Tactics
- **Protect, don’t isolate:** Use hearing protection for truly loud settings (concerts, tools), but **avoid** constant plug use in normal sound.  
- **Volume hygiene:** 60/60 rule for headphones (≤60% volume, ≤60 minutes at a time).  
- **Sleep routine:** Regular schedule, lower caffeine late, wind-down audio at low level.  
- **Medication review:** Ask your clinician to check for ototoxic risks before starting/stopping anything.  
- **Track patterns:** Log tinnitus loudness vs. stress, sleep, BP, caffeine, salt, alcohol. Adjust gradually.
