  "intro": "Hi, I'm Mehmet Kemal — a software developer and lawyer. I've been living with chronic tinnitus for about 8 years.\n\nTinnitus is a benign but incredibly challenging condition that modern medicine hasn't fully solved yet. It's a constant ringing, whistling, or buzzing in your ears that never stops. To cope with it, you need access to hearing tests and sound therapy tools. But these resources are often expensive or simply unavailable.\n\nThat's why I built HearWell. A free, open-source toolkit for hearing health, accessible to everyone. Hearing health should be accessible — not locked behind paywalls.\n\nI dedicate HearWell.life to everyone who keeps listening, even through the noise."
