  "conditionTinnitusTitle": "Tinnitus (non-pulsatile)",
  "conditionTinnitusDesc": "A sound no one else hears—often ringing, hissing, whistling. Frequently linked to hearing-pathway changes after noise exposure, aging, or middle-ear issues. Anxiety, poor sleep, and stress can amplify it.",

  "conditionTinnitusLink2": "AAO-HNS CPG",
  "conditionPulsatileTitle": "Pulsatile Tinnitus",
  "conditionPulsatileDesc": "A rhythmic sound in time with your heartbeat. Needs medical evaluation to rule out vascular/middle-ear causes. Work-up may include targeted imaging based on exam.",

  "conditionHyperacusisTitle": "Hyperacusis (Sound Sensitivity)",
  "conditionHyperacusisDesc": "Everyday sounds feel too loud or painful. Often co-occurs with tinnitus, migraine spectrum, or anxiety. Care focuses on graded sound exposure, counseling, and avoiding constant earplug use in safe environments.",
  "conditionHyperacusisLink1": "NIH/NCBI review",
  "conditionMenieresTitle": "Ménière's Disease",
  "conditionMenieresDesc": "Spells of vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and ear fullness (classically unilateral). Salt moderation, trigger management, and specialist care are typical.",
  "conditionSsnhlTitle": "Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss (SSNHL)",
  "conditionSsnhlDesc": "Rapid inner-ear hearing drop (usually one ear) over ≤72 hours. This is an emergency. Early audiometry and evidence-based treatment (often steroids) improve odds of recovery.",

  "conditionPresbycusisTitle": "Presbycusis (Age-Related)",
  "conditionPresbycusisDesc": "Gradual high-frequency hearing decline; speech sounds less clear, especially in noise. Modern hearing aids and communication strategies help.",
  "conditionEtdTitle": "Eustachian Tube Dysfunction (ETD)",
  "conditionEtdDesc": "Ear pressure/fullness, popping, muffled hearing, often after colds/allergies or flights. Treat nose/allergy; autoinflation; specialist if persistent.",
  "conditionOtotoxicTitle": "Ototoxic Medications",
  "conditionOtotoxicDesc": "Some antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides), chemotherapy (e.g., cisplatin), loop diuretics, high-dose salicylates/NSAIDs, and others can cause tinnitus or hearing loss. Never stop a prescribed drug without medical advice.",
